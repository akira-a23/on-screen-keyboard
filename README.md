# Simple On-Screen Keyboard with Trackpad (Web-Based)

This is a basic on-screen keyboard with a simulated trackpad, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to work within a web browser.

## How to Use

1.  **Save the code:** Copy the entire HTML code (the one we just finished with the touch screen compatibility) into a text editor.
2.  **Save as `index.html`:** Make sure you save the file with the name `index.html`. Your computer might try to save it as a `.txt` file, so change the "Save as type" to "All Files" if needed.
3.  **Open in a browser:** Open the `index.html` file in any web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

You should see the on-screen keyboard and the trackpad area.

* **Typing:** Click or tap on the keys of the keyboard to type letters and numbers into the text box at the top.
* **Space:** Use the "space" key to add spaces.
* **Enter:** Use the "enter" key to go to a new line in the text box.
* **Simulated Trackpad:**
    * The gray area to the right is the simulated trackpad.
    * The "Left Click" and "Right Click" buttons at the bottom can be clicked or tapped. Currently, left click will focus on the text box, and right click will show a simple message.
    * You can try dragging your mouse or swiping your finger on the trackpad area to see the text in the output box scroll. This is just a simple example of what you could make the trackpad do within the webpage.

## What it Does

This project demonstrates how to create an interactive on-screen keyboard and a basic simulated trackpad using web technologies. It's a fun way to learn about HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for making things interactive.

## Limitations

* **Browser-Based:** This keyboard and trackpad only work within the web browser where you open the `index.html` file. It cannot type or control your mouse cursor in other applications on your computer.
* **Basic Functionality:** This is a simple version. It doesn't include features like uppercase letters, shift keys, symbols, or more advanced trackpad gestures that a real on-screen keyboard or trackpad would have.

## Next Steps (Things you could try!)

* **More Styling:** Make the keyboard and trackpad look even cooler with more CSS!
* **Uppercase Letters:** Add a "Shift" key and make the letters change when it's pressed.
* **Symbols:** Include buttons for punctuation marks and other symbols.
* **More Trackpad Actions:** Think of other things you could control within the webpage using the trackpad (like moving a slider or drawing).
* **Different Layouts:** Try arranging the keys in a different way.

Have fun experimenting!
